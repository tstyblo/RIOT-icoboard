### Overview

Only flash memory programming is supported when using the standard build targets.

First you must program icosoc.bin into the flash memory:

# icoprog -f < icosoc.bin

This is needed only the first time.

You can obtain icosoc.bin by compiling one of the examples in the icosoc distribution.

Then you can use the following to compile and load the example apps into the flash memory:

# make flash
# make reset
# make term
